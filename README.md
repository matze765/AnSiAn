This project is based on the RFAnalyzer by Dennis Mantz https://github.com/demantz/RFAnalyzer. 
Further development by Markus Grau, Steffen Kreis (AnSiAn v1); Dennis Mantz, Max Engelhardt (AnSiAn v2) and Matthias Kannwischer (AnSiAn v3)

#Abstract of v3
During the last years multiple low cost SDR capable of transmitting and receiving a very large frequency range have been released. These devices like the HackRF One make signal processing experiments feasible for a large user group. AnSiAn together with a HackRF driver enables signal analysis and synthesis on Android smartphones. In this project the AnSiAn application is extended, such that it provides more features for amateur radio communications. This includes speech signals using SSB modulation, images using SSTV and text using Morse and PSK31. Additionally we implement the modulation of RDS signals. With the new features added, AnSiAn is a comprehensive amateur radio application that is easy to use, portable and extensible for more complex communication protocols.
