\chapter*{Abstract}

SDR platforms like the \emph{HackRF} enable their users to explore the electromagnetic spectrum. While a wide range of SDR software toolkits, such as gqrx and SDR\#{}, is available for computers, little such software exists for more mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. AnSiAn is a portable open-source SDR toolkit for Android devices that enables users to inconspicuously monitor the wireless spectrum anywhere. In this lab, AnSiAn's performance was improved and its feature set was extended by adding support for the SDRPlay and rad1o SDR platforms, demodulators for RDS and PSK31 and transmission capability for raw I/Q-Files, Morse and PSK31.
