\chapter{Project Progress\label{ch:project_progress}}

This chapter documents the progress of the project throughout the three
sprints (alpha, beta and final version). Each sprint had a pre\-pen\-ded
planning phase, in which the sprint targets were discussed and potentially
adjusted. This procedure goes along well with the Agile Manifesto which
encourages the design of a complex system in small incremental parts.

The detailed process, as well as the planned targets and actual
results for each sprint, are mentioned in the sections below.

Git was used as version control system in order to document changes and
progress of the source code. The GitHub page can be found at

\section{Sprint 1: Alpha Version}

The planned features for the first sprint were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item RDS demodulation
	\item PSK31 demodulation
	\item Logging the output of digital demodulators (Morse, RDS and PSK31)
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, there were several unforseen tasks that had to be treated
before the new features could actually be implemented. These are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The migration to Android Studio
	\item Necessary memory management optimizations
	\item Refactoring tasks on the Morse \ac{GUI}
	\item Bugfix: Broken scanner mode when using the \emph{HackRF}
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the PSK31 demodulation had to be postponed to sprint two. The
logging feature was deferred to the last sprint, when both RDS and
PSK31 are finished.


\section{Sprint 2: Beta Version}

Because of the exam phase, the feature set for sprint two was consciously
kept small and the transmission-related features were pushed to sprint
three. The features planned for the second sprint were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item RDS demodulation optimizations
	\item PSK31 demodulation
	\item Morse demodulation (refactoring)
	\item SDRplay support
\end{itemize}

Additionally to the planned features, a bugfix to fix the
broken recording feature of \ac{AnSiAn} was implemented, which helped in developing the
PSK31 demodulation algorithm.

\section{Sprint 3: Final Version}

The final sprint included the remaining mandatory features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item rad1o support
	\item Logging the output of digital demodulators (Morse, RDS and PSK31)
	\item Transmission
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Raw IQ file
			\item Morse transmission
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Also, many \ac{GUI} fixes and cleanups were included into the final version
as well as an additional PSK31 transmission feature and a finalized
Morse demodulation algorithm.
